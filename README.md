# CPS 271- Object Features of C++

This is a selection of the homework problems for the Washtenaw Community College class [CPS 271 - Object Features of C++](https://catalog.wccnet.edu/current/courses/cps-271.php) which I took in Fall 2022.

"In this course, students will continue the study of C++ by learning the object-oriented features of the language. Topics include classes, constructors and destructors, operator overloading, pointers, dynamic allocation of memory, inheritance, polymorphism, file manipulation, templates, and exceptions.."
